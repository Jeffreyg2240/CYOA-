Upon leaving the world of games, you appear in a room with a demon goat statue with three hands. Each hand holding a pill of varied colors, in his left hand is a purple pill that shines in the dim light from the goat's eyes. The right hand holds a green pill that looks more liquid than actual solid pill and lastly the blue pill that's being held in his middle hand that was coming from his chest. The blue pill was giving off the scent of apple pie and looked like a pure solid pill compared to the other pills in the room.

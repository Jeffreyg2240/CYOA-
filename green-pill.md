You take the green pill and a random bottle of diet coke appears, you take the pill and drink the diet coke to help swallow the pill. You suddenly feel sick and the room begins to spin around as you fall down, through the floor into a void. You fall for what feels like hours and upon closing your eyes for a second, you awaken in a corridor with two metal doors. It's just pure quiet in the corridor, one door on your right and one door on your left.

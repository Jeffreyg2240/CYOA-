Upon picking the middle door, you see two more doors. One door on each side and the time is ticking for you, you can the faint sound of rats and possiblily a voice from behind one door and the sound of wind pressed against the other. You can pick between the left hand door or the right hand door, choking on the slience in hopes of making a choice.

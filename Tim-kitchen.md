You open the right door and appear to have entered a kitchen, the kitchen had the name _**TIM**_ burnt into the wall, and you hear this echo of a a word that sounds like Tim. You can see the sunlight from the outside locked window, you can see that you are close to the backyard, but right now infront of you there are 2 more doors.
